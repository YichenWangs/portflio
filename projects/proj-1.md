# Abstract

We present an interactive sound art work, Sonic Sculptural Staircase, that delivers a sonic experience to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings in a head-mounted augmented reality system. Our work includes ten different interactive sonic features with visual overlays to incorporate the staircase for users to explore. We describe the design and implementation of our system and provide a demo video of it in use.

# Introduction 

Sonic Sculptural Staircase is a head-mounted augmented reality (HMAR)  sound artwork that integrates sound, visual overlay and interaction to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings. The work designed ten different interactive sonic features that mainly exploits sound as the main information channel to prompt the user’s engagement and convey the meaning behind the staircase.

The work is realised with Microsoft HoloLens 2  Augmented Reality(AR) headset and was programmed based upon the 3D staircase model as holograms in Unity. The work explored two different types of sound: context-related recordings and electronic sound,  that combines interaction and visual into AR holograms to present an immersive experience.

Previous work in this field has achieved a personalised sonic experience that incorporates real-world features. By embedding sound sources in AR holograms (that model the physical environment), one can directly access the information as well as engage with  a sculpture . Such installations not only augment the user’s experience but also provide a new practice of using sound in HMAR. Other sonic applications in HMAR such as Augmented Piano  and INVISO AR  have explored visual overlays to assist music composition and performance.
