## Abstract

We present an interactive sound art work, Sonic Sculptural Staircase, that delivers a sonic experience to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings in a head-mounted augmented reality system. Our work includes ten different interactive sonic features with visual overlays to incorporate the staircase for users to explore. We describe the design and implementation of our system and provide a demo video of it in use.

## Introduction 

Sonic Sculptural Staircase is a head-mounted augmented reality (HMAR)  sound artwork that integrates sound, visual overlay and interaction to enhance the appreciation of a sculptural staircase and its surroundings. The work designed ten different interactive sonic features that mainly exploits sound as the main information channel to prompt the user’s engagement and convey the meaning behind the staircase.

The work is realised with Microsoft HoloLens 2  Augmented Reality(AR) headset and was programmed based upon the 3D staircase model as holograms in Unity. The work explored two different types of sound: context-related recordings and electronic sound,  that combines interaction and visual into AR holograms to present an immersive experience.

Previous work in this field has achieved a personalised sonic experience that incorporates real-world features. By embedding sound sources in AR holograms (that model the physical environment), one can directly access the information as well as engage with  a sculpture . Such installations not only augment the user’s experience but also provide a new practice of using sound in HMAR. Other sonic applications in HMAR such as Augmented Piano  and INVISO AR  have explored visual overlays to assist music composition and performance.

Recent advancements that integrate so-called ‘instinctual interaction’ into HMAR systems enable vivid tactile experiences, allowing the touch, grasp, and movement of virtual objects like one would with real objects as well as interactive aural sensations and feedback . These HMAR affordances advance the interactive potential of mixed reality environments and allow further integration of interactive sound, and visuals. 

In this paper, we describe our sound artwork Sonic Sculptural Staircase that reflects the new development progress in HMAR as well as how sound can be utilised with interaction in a real-world setting. We first introduce the aesthetic background and description of the user experience in our work. We then discuss the design details of interactive sonic features in this sound artwork. We conclude our work by providing a video-demo that illustrates our design.

## Sonic Sculptural Staircase
Sonic Sculptural Staircase is created upon a staircase at the Hanna Neumann Building at the Australian National University (ANU). The work was designed to be triggered by sonic interaction and walking within the staircase to enhance people's awareness of its aesthetic context. Sound is exploited as the main information channel to covey meaning during this experience. Our sound sources are categorised to three themes: 1) mathematics-related sounds (e.g., chalkboard sketching sound) 2) computer science-related sounds: (e.g., keyboard typing sound) 3) sounds appearing in the building that map the aesthetic context or the occupants working environment (e.g., swipe-card sound).
